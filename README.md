# wiki

This repository holds the Obsidian vault that is used as our wiki. Open the folder with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit.

## Guidelines

### Content

The wiki's role is to always reflect true information about the studio and its project. As a result, it's not a place for brainstorming documents and idea proposals. For these things, prefer [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/playsthetic/discussions) or our [FigJam whiteboard](https://www.figma.com/file/xULU4HdgVVC5yS1Lzz1W00/Whiteboard?node-id=0%3A1&t=ZkT53uJU4czWmYqM-1).

### Pages and sections

Page and sections should be sentenced cased without periods, such as `This section`.

## Publishing

In order to publish, use the `Publish changes...` command in Obsidian. You won't be able to do so until you've been added as a collaborator via email.
