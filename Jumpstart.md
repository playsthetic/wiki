Welcome to Playsthetic, a game and software development studio fueled by Japan's golden era of video games and animation.

On the infrastructure side, our goal is to stay super light. This means you'll be working from your personal computer, and you won't get yet another email inbox. Everything should integrate well with the accounts you may already have, such as [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Pre-requisites

If you haven't done that already, the first things you'll need to do is join our Discord server using [this invite link](https://discord.gg/x2w3y8axUF).

Next, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and the Git client of your choice. For regular users, we recommend [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/download/), and for the more advanced ones, [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/download) or the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).Â 

> [!Warning]  
> If you decide to go with [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/download), be aware that it does not package with Git LFS. Most likely you will have to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) including LFS and set your SublimeMerge > Preferences > Advanced > Git Binary to system.|

Once done, drop us a message [here](https://discord.com/channels/473635736332271626/1025410007136731206) with your GitHub username, so we can invite you onboard the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/playsthetic). This will give you access to all our repositories.

## Working on a project

Working on a project is as simple as [cloning](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-clone.html) the [project's repository](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agame+org%3Aplaysthetic+fork%3Atrue) on your local machine.

Each project has its own requirements featured in a `README.md` file at the root of the repository, so make sure you read that before getting started.

## Pushing your work

[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are the mechanism we use to submit changes and review them before they can make it into the game. The workflow goes as follows:

1. [Target an issue](https://github.com/playsthetic/punch/issues) you want to be working on.
2. [Create a branch](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-branchtag.html#tgit-dug-branch-1) named something like my-new-feature.
3. Make modifications until you are happy.
4. [Push your changes](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-push.html) to the server.
5. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) manually or using CreatePullRequest.bat.
6. Move on with your life.

The pull request page will give us a platform for reviewing and discussing the changes. In order to work efficiently, the following practices are recommended:

- Commit often (so you can iterate without fear).
- Push always (so history is never just on your machine).
- Create draft pull requests early (so we can always see the sum of your changes).

## Playing through Steam

There will be a version of the games reflecting the `HEAD` of the `main` development [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) available on Steam at all times. In order to gain access to these builds, you will have to be added to the [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/) partnership. Drop us a [message](https://discord.com/channels/473635736332271626/1025410007136731206) on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x2w3y8axUF) with your email so you can be invited.  

Once onboarded, you should see the game like any other Steam game. Make sure to switch to the "main" beta branch following [these instructions](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9847-WHXC-7326&l=english).

## Communication

Direct communication is happening through our [Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/473635736332271626/1025410007136731206) via text or voice channels. A [Figma whiteboard](https://www.figma.com/file/xULU4HdgVVC5yS1Lzz1W00/Whiteboard?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=gc6QlSlkfTgGdUx2-1) is also here to facilitate exchange of ideas during live sessions.

## Ideas and questions

In order to keep track of ideas and questions related to the studio, we are leveraging [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/playsthetic/discussions). You can see that as our own private Stack Overflow.

## Social activities

We like to keep it super light on the social side and let things happen naturally. Use our curated [Google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1nNltV1T2IXVL7NmpxB28gjIyVYfK4slX&usp=sharing) to share cool spots on the planet.

## File exchanges

For simple file exchanges, we have set up a shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/102jWVDGEzgV360VGnHh-r6Yl77EviAQu?usp=sharing) to which you will need to request access.

## Last words

Thanks for your time going through these lines. We tried to keep it as short and simple as possible, so hopefully, it wasn't too painful. More specific information can be found in the "Guidelines" section. We hope you'll have fun working with us.
