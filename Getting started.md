Welcome to Playsthetic, a game and software development studio fueled by Japan's golden era of video games and animation.

## Pre-requisites

The first thing you'll need is a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and access to our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/playsthetic). You should have received an email invitation for that, but if you haven't, tell us about it on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/473635736332271626/1025410007136731206) .

Next, you'll need the Git client of your choice. For regular users, we recommend [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/download/), and for the more advanced ones, [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/download) or the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

> [!Warning]  
> If you decide to go with [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/download), be aware that it does not package with Git LFS. Most likely you will have to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) including LFS and set your **SublimeMerge > Preferences > Advanced > Git Binary** to `system`.|

## Working on a project

Working on a project is as simple as [cloning](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-clone.html) the [project's repository](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agame+org%3Aplaysthetic+fork%3Atrue) on your local machine.

> [!Info]  
> Each project has its own requirements featured in a `README.md` file at the root of the repository. Make sure you read that before getting started.

## Pushing your work

[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are the mechanism we use to submit changes and review them before they can make it into the game. The workflow goes as follows:

1. [Target a project issue](https://github.com/orgs/playsthetic/projects) you want to be working on.
2. [Create a branch](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-branchtag.html#tgit-dug-branch-1) named something like `my-new-feature`.
3. Make modifications until you are happy.
4. [Push your changes](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-push.html) to the server.
5. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) manually or using `CreatePullRequest.bat`.
6. Move on with your life.

The pull request page will give us a platform for reviewing and discussing the changes. In order to work efficiently, the following practices are recommended:

- Commit often (so you can iterate without fear).
- Push always (so history is never just on your machine).
- Create draft pull requests early (so we can always see the sum of your changes).

## Playing through Steam

There will be a version of the games reflecting the `HEAD` of the `main` development [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) available on Steam at all times. In order to gain access to these builds, you will have to be added to the [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/) partnership. Drop a [message](https://discord.com/channels/473635736332271626/1025410007136731206) on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x2w3y8axUF) with your email, so you can be invited.  

Once onboarded, you should see the game like any other Steam game. Make sure to switch to the `main` beta branch following [these instructions](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9847-WHXC-7326&l=english).

## Communication

Direct communication is happening through our [Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/473635736332271626/1025410007136731206) via text or voice channels. A [Figma whiteboard](https://www.figma.com/file/xULU4HdgVVC5yS1Lzz1W00/Whiteboard?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=gc6QlSlkfTgGdUx2-1) is also here to facilitate exchange of ideas during live sessions.

## Ideas and questions

In order to keep track of ideas and questions related to the studio, we are leveraging [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/playsthetic/discussions). You can see it as our own private [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

## Social activities

We like to keep it super light on the social side and let things happen naturally. Use our curated [Google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1nNltV1T2IXVL7NmpxB28gjIyVYfK4slX&usp=sharing) to share cool spots on the planet.

## Events

We register our studio events in a dedicated [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com). If you have not been invited, [let us know](https://discord.com/channels/473635736332271626/1025410007136731206).

## File exchange

For files that are not meant to be tracked on Git and are too big for Discord, we have set up a shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/102jWVDGEzgV360VGnHh-r6Yl77EviAQu?usp=sharing) to which you will need to request access.

## Last words

Thanks for taking the time to go through these lines. We tried to keep things short, but there was quite a bit to go through. Hopefully this wasn't too painful. For more specific information about workflows, make sure to check the "Guidelines" section. We hope you'll have fun working with us.
