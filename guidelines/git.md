# Git

## Commit messages

The first line, also known as the commit summary, should not exceed `72` characters and be written sentence cased with no period, such as, `Add cat images`.

Any additional notes, also known as the commit body, should be separated by a blank line. [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) can be used in this section, since it's supported by GitHub.

Write your commit message in the imperative: `Fix bug` and not `Fixed bug`. This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like `git merge` and `git revert`.

> [!Note] 
> Should we use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)? Probably but for now keep things simple and do not.
