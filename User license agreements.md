User license agreements (or ULA) are a complicated subject. But basic principles dictate that any licensed asset that has not been made internally such as fonts, sounds, music tracks, plugins, or artworks should be purchased by the company and credited. These assets can be then re-used across all our projects. All this needs to be in good standing order the moment the game is released.
