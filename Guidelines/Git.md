## Commit messages

The first line (or commit summary) should not exceed 72 characters and be written sentence cased with no period, such as, “Add chat images”.

Any additional commit notes (or body) should be separated by a blank line. [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) can be used in this section, since it’s supported by GitHub.
  
Write your commit message in the imperative: `Fix bug` and not `FixedBug`. This convention matches up with commit messages

generated by commands like `git merge` and `git revert`.
