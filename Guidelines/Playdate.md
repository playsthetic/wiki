## Code

We follow most Lua conventions. Class are Pascal cased, variables are camel cased, `.lua` files are snake cased such as `my_file.lua`.

## Assets

Assets live in `/source/assets` and are stored by type such as `audio`, `images`, or`fonts` are hyphen separated such as `my-cool-image.png`, we made this decisision because of the suffix required for image tables such as `-table-16-16.png`.
